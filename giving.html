          Remnant Kingdom Stewards covers the global network of believers who
          are committed to the Biblical principles of Righteous Living. The
          result is an informed platform for various forms of financial
          engagement that strengthen the mutuality of our covenant relationship
          as we see in 2 Cor. 9:6-14 As the early church thrived in oneness and
          unity of purpose that greatly impacted the degree of power available
          to the Apostles in Acts 4:33 and ensured that no one lacked Acts 4:34.

          Becoming an RKS partner requires a sacrificial commitment from each
          partner to first give of themselves to God in a consecrated lifestyle.
          Every act of generosity must be channeled from right and honest
          living.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
          Every committed partner must be intentional and Spirit driven. We look
          forward to being committed to the mandate given to God's servant Rev.
          Victor Anaele, in uplifting him and the Ministry before God in
          prayers, that the work of God may continually advance.
